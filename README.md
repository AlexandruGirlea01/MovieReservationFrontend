Welcome to the front-end repository of my Angular web application! This app allows users to create an account, login, view available projections, make/delete reservations, and modify their account details.

The front-end is built using Angular for responsive design. It utilizes a RESTful API to communicate with the server-side of the application.

Features:

- User authentication and authorization for secure access to the application
- User registration and profile management
- View available projections and select seats for reservations
- Make and delete reservations with ease
- Modify account details
